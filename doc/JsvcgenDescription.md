JSON-RPC Description Format
===========================

This is the format for specifying your web service to `jsvcgen`.
It is JSON-based and uses a mix of concepts from [json-schema][json-schema], [JSON-WSP][JSON-WSP] and
 [Swagger][Swagger-spec].
The file extension is simply `.json`.
The official MIME type is `"application/json+jsvcgen-description"`, but `"application/json"` is perfectly fine.

TODO: Actually write some documentation.
